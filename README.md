# Foucault
A small terminal UI note taking app.
Build over sqlite through [rusqlite](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite) and [sea_query](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query) for the database and [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) for the UI.

Note are taken in (limited) markdown.
The app aims to supports Tags as well as Cross referencing notes.

In short: another hobby project that will keep my attention for approximately two weeks...
